# Auto Repair Shop : Frontend Technical Test Submission

## Context

This README documents my solution for the Internship React Front-end Developer interview test. The task was to build a frontend application for an auto repair shop to track and log customer visits. The focus was on creating an interactive and dynamic user interface using ReactJS and TypeScript, incorporating key features such as data representation, asynchronous data loading, search functionality, and service management.

## Features

The application includes the following main features:

- **Data Representation**: An array of objects representing customer and related services records.
- **Asynchronous Data Loading**: Customer data is displayed in the UI and loaded asynchronously.
- **Customer Search**: A search input feature allows searching for customers based on their attributes.
- **Customer Removal**: A button to remove a customer.

## Technologies

The following technologies were used to complete this test:

- **Languages**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: ReactJS
- **Packages**:
    - **Tanstack (React Table)**: For creating and managing tables.
    - **Chakra UI**: For building user interface components.
    - **Moment JS**: For managing dates and times.

## Instructions

1. **Data Construction**: I created an array of objects to represent the four sample customer records.
2. **UI Implementation**: Using the array created, I displayed the customers in the UI. The data is loaded asynchronously.
3. **Search Functionality**: Implemented a search input feature to enable searching for customers based on their attributes.
4. **Service Management**: Added a button that allows the removal of a customer.

## Usage

To run and explore the application, please follow these steps:

1. **Open the project**: Access the project via [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).
2. **Explore the Features**:
    - **Customer Data**: View the list of customers and their respective services.
    - **Search**: Use the search bar to find customers based on their attributes.
    - **Remove Service**: Click the button next to a customer to remove it from the record.

## Code Conventions

The code adheres to the following conventions:

- All variables and function names use camelCase.
- The application is built using TypeScript and React.
